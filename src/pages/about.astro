      <h1>About Yousif Abood</h1>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-8">
        I'm a software engineer passionate about building elegant, efficient solutions to complex
        problems. My work spans web development, system architecture, and creative technical
        projects.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <p>
        I specialize in full-stack web development with a focus on modern JavaScript frameworks and
        cloud technologies. Whether it's crafting responsive user interfaces, designing scalable
        backend systems, or optimizing performance, I enjoy every aspect of bringing ideas to life
        through code.
      </p>

      <p>
        This website serves as my digital gardenâ€”a space where I share my projects, write about
        technologies that excite me, and document my journey in software development. You'll find
        tutorials, insights, and thoughts on building better software.
      </p>

      <h2>Technical Interests</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Beyond Code</h2>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I'm usually exploring new technologies, reading about software
        engineering practices, or working on side projects that challenge me to learn something new.
        I believe in continuous learning and sharing knowledge with the developer community.
      </p>

      <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
      <p>
