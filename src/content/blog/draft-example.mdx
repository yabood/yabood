This is a draft post that demonstrates the draft functionality.

## Only Visible in Development

This post will:

- ✅ Show up when running `npm run dev` (development mode)
- ❌ NOT show up when you build for production (`npm run build`)
- ❌ NOT appear in RSS feeds

## Testing Your Draft System

To test that drafts are working correctly:

1. Run your site in development mode: `npm run dev`
2. You should see this post in the blog listing
3. Build your site for production: `npm run build && npm run preview`
4. This post should NOT appear in the production build

## Converting to Published

When you're ready to publish this post, simply change `draft: true` to `draft: false` in the frontmatter, or remove the draft field entirely (it defaults to false).
