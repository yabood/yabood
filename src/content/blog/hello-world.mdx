import Prose from '../../components/Prose.astro';

Welcome to my new blog! This is the first post on a site built with **Astro**, a modern static site generator that delivers lightning-fast performance and excellent developer experience.

## Why Astro?

After evaluating various static site generators and frameworks, I chose Astro for several compelling reasons:

### 1. Zero JavaScript by Default

Astro ships zero JavaScript to the client by default, resulting in incredibly fast page loads. When you do need interactivity, Astro's **Islands Architecture** allows you to hydrate only the components that need it.

```astro
---
// This runs at build time
const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data').then(r => r.json());
---

<!-- This HTML is static -->
<div>{data.title}</div>

<!-- This component is interactive only when needed -->
<InteractiveComponent client:visible />
```

### 2. Content-First Approach

With built-in support for Markdown and MDX, Astro makes it easy to focus on writing content while still having the flexibility to include interactive components when needed.

### 3. Framework Agnostic

Astro supports components from React, Vue, Svelte, and more. You can even mix and match frameworks in the same project!

## Tech Stack Overview

This blog is built with a carefully selected tech stack optimized for performance and developer experience:

- **Astro** - Static site generation with partial hydration
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first CSS with minimal bundle size
- **MDX** - Markdown with JSX components for rich content
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better developer experience

## Performance Optimizations

### Image Optimization

Using Astro's built-in `<Image />` component, all images are automatically optimized:

```astro
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import heroImage from '../assets/hero.jpg';

<Image 
  src={heroImage} 
  alt="Hero" 
  widths={[240, 540, 720, 1080]}
  sizes="(max-width: 360px) 240px, (max-width: 720px) 540px, (max-width: 1600px) 720px, 1080px"
/>
```

### SEO & Structured Data

Every page includes comprehensive SEO metadata and JSON-LD structured data for rich snippets:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BlogPosting",
  "headline": "Hello World: Building a Modern Blog with Astro",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Yousif Abood"
  },
  "datePublished": "2025-08-10T08:00:00+00:00"
}
```

## Core Web Vitals

This site achieves excellent Core Web Vitals scores:

- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: < 2.5s
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: < 100ms
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: < 0.1

<div class="my-8 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-accent bg-accent/10 p-4">
  <p class="font-semibold">ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip</p>
  <p class="mt-2">Use Astro's built-in `prefetch` directive to preload links on hover, making navigation feel instant:</p>
  <code class="mt-2 block rounded bg-gray-900 p-2 text-sm text-gray-100">
    {`<a href="/about" data-astro-prefetch>About</a>`}
  </code>
</div>

## What's Next?

In upcoming posts, I'll dive deeper into:

1. **Advanced Astro Patterns** - Component composition and data fetching strategies
2. **Tailwind CSS v4 Features** - Exploring the latest improvements and optimizations
3. **MDX Components** - Building reusable components for rich content
4. **Deployment Strategies** - Optimizing for GitHub Pages and CDN delivery

## Conclusion

Building this blog with Astro has been a fantastic experience. The combination of excellent performance, developer experience, and flexibility makes it an ideal choice for content-focused websites.

Stay tuned for more posts about web development, performance optimization, and modern tooling!
