Spent the weekend doing a deep dive into existing cloud security scanning tools. The landscape is more crowded than I initially thought, but also more opportunity than expected.

## Major Players Analysis

### **Scout Suite** (Open Source)
- **Pros**: Multi-cloud support, active community, good AWS coverage
- **Cons**: Python-based (slow), centralized architecture, limited customization
- **Architecture**: Traditional pull-and-analyze model

### **Prowler** (Open Source)  
- **Pros**: Excellent AWS coverage, CIS benchmarks, growing popularity
- **Cons**: Bash-heavy codebase, single-cloud focus, performance issues
- **Architecture**: Command-line tool, runs centrally

### **CloudSploit** (Commercial)
- **Pros**: Clean UI, good reporting, multi-cloud
- **Cons**: SaaS-only, expensive, limited customization
- **Architecture**: Centralized SaaS platform

### **Bridgecrew/Prisma** (Enterprise)
- **Pros**: Comprehensive coverage, enterprise features, policy management
- **Cons**: Very expensive, vendor lock-in, heavyweight
- **Architecture**: Enterprise SaaS with complex deployment

## Gap Analysis

What's missing from the current market:

### 1. **Performance at Scale**
All existing tools struggle with large infrastructures. Even Prowler (considered fast) takes hours for enterprise scans.

### 2. **Developer Experience**  
Security scanning is divorced from development workflows. Developers can't easily scan their local Terraform before deploying.

### 3. **Edge/Offline Capabilities**
No tool works well in disconnected environments or provides real-time scanning at edge locations.

### 4. **Customization & Extensions**
Most tools have rigid rule sets. Enterprises need custom policies that match their specific requirements.

## Opportunity Space

The edge-native approach addresses **all** these gaps simultaneously:

- **WebAssembly enables performance** - compiled code vs interpreted scripts
- **Local execution improves developer experience** - scan before you deploy  
- **Edge deployment enables offline/real-time** - no network dependencies
- **Plugin architecture enables customization** - write rules in any language

## Validation Points

Market research confirms several key assumptions:
1. **Performance is a real pain point** - multiple Reddit threads complaining about scan times
2. **Developer adoption is limited** - security teams use these tools, not developers
3. **Edge computing interest is growing** - but nobody's applying it to security yet

## Strategic Positioning

SkyScaN won't compete directly with enterprise tools like Prisma. Instead, focus on:

- **Developer-first experience** like how Docker revolutionized deployment
- **Performance leadership** through modern architecture choices
- **Universal deployment** as a key differentiator

The more I research, the more convinced I am this is a real opportunity.
