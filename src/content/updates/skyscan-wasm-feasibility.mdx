---

Needed to validate that WebAssembly can actually handle the computational complexity of security scanning before committing to the architecture. Built some proof-of-concept modules to test the waters.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. **JSON Parsing Performance**
Cloud configurations are massive JSON documents. Tested parsing AWS CloudFormation templates:

```rust
use serde_json;
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn parse_cloudformation(template: &str) -> Result<JsValue, JsValue> {
    let parsed: serde_json::Value = serde_json::from_str(template)
        .map_err(|e| JsValue::from_str(&e.to_string()))?;
    Ok(JsValue::from_serde(&parsed).unwrap())
}
```

**Results**: 
- **50MB CloudFormation template**: Parsed in 23ms (WASM) vs 89ms (Node.js)
- **Memory usage**: 60% lower than equivalent JavaScript

### 2. **Vulnerability Database Matching**
Security scanning requires matching resources against vulnerability databases. Tested with 50k+ CVE records:

```rust
use regex::Regex;
use std::collections::HashMap;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub struct VulnMatcher {
    patterns: HashMap<String, Regex>,
}

impl VulnMatcher {
    pub fn match_vulnerabilities(&self, resource: &str) -> Vec<String> {
        // Complex pattern matching logic
        self.patterns.iter()
            .filter_map(|(vuln_id, pattern)| {
                if pattern.is_match(resource) {
                    Some(vuln_id.clone())
                } else {
                    None
                }
            })
            .collect()
    }
}
```

**Results**:
- **Vulnerability matching**: 3.2x faster than JavaScript regex
- **Binary size**: 1.8MB compiled WASM (acceptable for edge deployment)

### 3. **Cloud Provider API Simulation**
Tested HTTP requests and JSON processing for simulated cloud API responses:

**Results**:
- **HTTP performance**: Equivalent to native (limited by network, not compute)
- **JSON processing**: Consistently 2-4x faster than JavaScript
- **Memory efficiency**: Predictable allocation patterns

## Real-World Implications

The performance gains are significant enough to matter:

### **Developer Workflow Impact**
- **Local scanning** becomes fast enough for pre-commit hooks
- **CI/CD integration** won't add significant build time
- **Real-time feedback** becomes feasible during development

### **Edge Deployment Viability**  
- **Cold start performance** is acceptable for edge functions
- **Memory footprint** fits within edge compute constraints
- **Binary size** downloads quickly even on mobile networks

### **Scale Economics**
- **Reduced compute costs** from better performance per CPU cycle
- **Lower bandwidth** from processing data where it lives
- **Fewer API calls** by batching and local processing

## Technical Challenges Identified

1. **Debugging complexity** - WASM debugging tools are still immature
2. **Library ecosystem** - Not all Rust crates compile to WASM
3. **File system access** - Limited I/O capabilities in browser environments

But none of these are blockers for the core use cases.

## Architecture Decisions

Based on this validation:

1. **Rust + WASM core** for performance-critical scanning logic
2. **JavaScript wrapper** for I/O and environment integration  
3. **Modular design** to work around WASM limitations
4. **Progressive enhancement** - fallback to native execution when needed

WebAssembly is definitely viable for this use case. Moving forward with confidence on the technical architecture.
