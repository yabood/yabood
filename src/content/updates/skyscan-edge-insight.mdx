Been thinking more about yesterday's conversation at re:Invent. The more I dig into current cloud security tools, the more convinced I become that we're solving the wrong problem.

## The Centralized Scanning Problem

Every major security tool today follows the same pattern:

1. **Central server** pulls configuration from your cloud accounts
2. **Heavy analysis** happens on their infrastructure
3. **Results pushed back** to you via dashboards/alerts

This creates fundamental issues:

### Latency & Performance

- **Round-trip delays** for every API call across regions
- **Rate limiting** from cloud providers slows everything down
- **Network bandwidth** becomes a bottleneck with large infrastructures

### Security & Privacy

- **Credentials** must be shared with third-party services
- **Configuration data** leaves your environment entirely
- **Compliance concerns** with sensitive infrastructure details

### Availability & Reliability

- **Single points of failure** when scanning services go down
- **Regional outages** can block critical security workflows
- **Vendor lock-in** with proprietary analysis engines

## The Edge-Native Vision

What if we flipped the entire model?

Instead of pulling data to a central system, **push intelligence to where the data lives**:

- **Developer workstations** for local development scanning
- **CI/CD pipelines** for deployment-time validation
- **Edge locations** for real-time infrastructure monitoring
- **Mobile devices** for on-the-go security checks

## Key Insights

1. **WebAssembly changes everything** - complex security analysis can now run anywhere
2. **Rust enables portability** - same codebase works on servers, browsers, and embedded systems
3. **Edge computing is mature** - CDN networks provide global compute infrastructure

The technical pieces are finally in place to make this work.

## Next Steps

Need to validate this isn't just theoretical. Going to start researching:

- What existing tools are already doing in this space
- Technical feasibility of WebAssembly for security scanning
- Performance benchmarks for edge vs centralized approaches

The vision is compelling, but needs to be grounded in reality.
