summary: "Initial brainstorm on building a modern security scanner that runs at the edge instead of centralized infrastructure."
---

Had an interesting conversation with a friend at AWS re:Invent about the challenges of cloud security scanning. Most tools today are centralized - you run them from one place and they reach out to scan your entire infrastructure.

But what if we flipped that model?

## The Core Insight

Instead of centralized scanning, what about **edge-native** security analysis? Push the scanning logic closer to the resources themselves:

- **Developer laptops** for local development
- **CI/CD pipelines** for deployment validation  
- **Edge locations** for real-time monitoring
- **Mobile devices** for on-the-go security checks

## Why This Matters

Current pain points with traditional scanners:
1. **Latency**: Round trips to central systems slow everything down
2. **Bandwidth**: Pulling massive amounts of config data across networks
3. **Availability**: Central systems become single points of failure
4. **Privacy**: Sensitive infrastructure data leaves your environment

An edge-native approach could solve all of these.

## Technical Challenges

The big question: how do you make sophisticated security analysis portable enough to run anywhere?

WebAssembly feels like the answer. Compile once, run everywhere - but with near-native performance for the heavy lifting that security scanning requires.

## Next Steps

Going to start with some research into existing tools and see how a Rust + WebAssembly approach could work. The vision is compelling but needs validation.
