After weeks of research and prototyping, I've settled on the core architecture for SkyScaN. The goal is to create a security scanner that can run anywhere - from developer laptops to edge locations worldwide.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Rust + WebAssembly Core

Choosing Rust for the core scanning engine gives us:

- **Memory safety** without garbage collection overhead
- **Native performance** for compute-intensive vulnerability analysis
- **WebAssembly target** for universal deployment (browsers, edge, serverless)

### 2. Plugin Architecture

Different cloud providers need different approaches. A plugin system lets us:

- Keep provider-specific logic isolated
- Enable community contributions
- Support custom enterprise integrations

### 3. Edge-First Design

Traditional security tools are centralized. SkyScaN will be distributed:

- **Local scanning** for development workflows
- **Edge deployment** for real-time monitoring
- **Federated results** for compliance reporting

## Research Findings

Spent time analyzing existing tools like Scout Suite, Prowler, and CloudSploit. Common pain points:

- **Slow execution** due to API rate limits
- **Limited customization** for enterprise environments
- **Poor developer experience** with complex setup requirements

SkyScaN will address each of these systematically.

## Next Phase

Moving into implementation with a focus on the core scanning engine. First milestone: get basic AWS resource discovery working with the plugin architecture.
