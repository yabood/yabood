summary: 'Hit the first end-to-end pass from ingest → parse → enrich → store.'
draft: true

Major milestone today! Got the first working end-to-end scan pipeline running locally. The architecture is coming together nicely:

## What's Working

- **Ingestion Layer**: Successfully pulling configuration data from AWS, Azure, and GCP
- **Parser Engine**: Clean separation between cloud providers, each with their own parsing logic
- **Enrichment Pipeline**: Basic vulnerability matching against CVE databases
- **Storage Layer**: Fast SQLite backend for local development, with plans for distributed storage

## Performance Numbers

Initial benchmarks are promising:

- **Scan Speed**: ~500 resources/second on my M2 MacBook
- **Memory Usage**: Under 50MB for typical enterprise infrastructure
- **Binary Size**: Just 8MB thanks to Rust's efficiency

The WebAssembly compilation is working beautifully - same code runs natively and in browser environments.

## Next Steps

Planning to tackle the distributed architecture next week. The edge deployment story is crucial for the product vision, so that's where I'm focusing next.

```rust
// Clean separation of concerns
pub trait CloudProvider {
    async fn discover(&self) -> Result<Vec<Resource>>;
    async fn scan(&self, resource: &Resource) -> Result<ScanResult>;
}

// Implementation stays isolated
impl CloudProvider for AwsProvider {
    async fn discover(&self) -> Result<Vec<Resource>> {
        // AWS-specific discovery logic
    }
}
```

Really excited about where this is heading!
